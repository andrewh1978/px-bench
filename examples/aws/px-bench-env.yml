# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/storage.html for links to various drivers available in EKS.
#
# EBS: Since Portworx would consume EBS volumes as Portworx Clouddrives, attempting "apples to apples" comparisons
#      between AWS native storage and Portworx  should be done with EBS volumes that are the same size as the
#      Portworx clouddrive used for the pool. 
#      Installation of the EBS CSI is documented here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html
#
#      The configmap below (see the Iteration Control section near the bottom) references an EBS storageclass 
#      called "ebs-sc", update it to your desired AWS storageclass. This example will benchmark "ebs-sc" vs.
#      the Portworx storageclass "px-csi-db"

  # Iteration Control: Each variable will be looped over to create the jobs to be run.
  #                    Do not change the variable name. The variable must consist of one or more space
  #                    delimited strings that are legal values for fio to use in a job file.

  #                    For now, the only supported variables here are blocksize and randwrite
  #
  #                    Example: If you have 2 blocksize values, and 3 randwrite values, this will result in 6 jobfiles.
